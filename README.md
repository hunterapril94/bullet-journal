## Inspiration

This project was inspired by creating goals. I always have an easier time accomplishing goals if they are presented in a visually appealing way. For many people that includes bullet journals. However I don't always have the creativity to bullet journal on a page myself. This is my attempt at creating a user friendly bullet journal that even the least artsy of us can accomplish.
## Features

One of the amazing parts of this project is you're able to choose a theme that will allow you to know what colors will look good together and create your journal based on this theme. You can choose what you want your border to be, what colors to use and what style of bullet you'd like including whether that needs to be a checklist.
